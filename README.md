# Your personal library

Managing your library has never been easier.

Main features:

- Add new books to your digital library, along with all necessary information about them - title, author, genre and number of pages. Each book also gets its serial number.
- Let the website know if you have already finished reading your book. If yes, it is marked as finished. Otherwise, a progress tracker will be displayed...
- Update the reading progress for each book by entering new reading milestones and see your progess illustrated by the progress tracker.
- If you hit the last page of your book, it will be marked as finished. Or you can mark it as finished straight away!
- You can add as many books as you like - the library will stray neatly organized and form in the sidebar will never get out of reach.
- If you wish to say goodbye to your book, you can simply delete it. Every remaining book will get its serial number automatically updated.

Main goals:

- Learn how to utilize constructor functions to maintain array of book objects.
- Take advantage of prototypal inheritance.
- Practice flexbox and grid layouts.
- Practice DOM manipulations, mainly dynamic creation of structured and interactive elements.
- This project was made as a part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) curriculum.

Have fun with this library and feel free to leave feedback.
